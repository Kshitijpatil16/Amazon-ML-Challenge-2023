# Amazon ML Challenge 23

Welcome to the Amazon ML Challenge 23 repository! This repository documents the approach and process used by Team Heracross to participate in the challenge. In this challenge, we utilized linear regression and XGBRegressor models to tackle the problem at hand.

## Little Abouts

### Linear Regression
Linear regression is a popular and widely-used technique in the field of machine learning for predicting numerical values. It assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable. In our case, we explored the possibility of using linear regression to predict the desired outcome based on the provided dataset.

### XGBRegressor
XGBRegressor is an implementation of the gradient boosting algorithm, which is known for its ability to handle complex relationships between variables and make accurate predictions. We employed XGBRegressor to capture the non-linear relationships in the data and improve the prediction performance.

## Dataset
We were provided train.csv and test.csv datasets for this challenge but they cannot be included in this repository so you'll have to change the datasets included in our Jyupter notebook

## Results

After extensive experimentation and training with the linear regression and XGBRegressor models, we achieved an accuracy of 31.2%. Although this accuracy is lower than the highest accuracy of 63.1% achieved by another participant, we are proud of our achievement and the learnings we gained throughout the challenge.

## Conclusion

We, Team Heracross, participated in the Amazon ML Challenge 23 with dedication and enthusiasm. Our approach involved utilizing linear regression and XGBRegressor models to tackle the problem. Although our accuracy of 31.2% was not the highest, we are proud of our rank of 199 and the knowledge we acquired during this challenge.
